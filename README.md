# Regular-Expressions
This program is a great practice for recursive solutions to algorithms.

The goal of this program is to be able to determine if a given string is a regular expression, which we may call regex. 
Recall that a regular expression matches a given string using a string pattern matching which is defined like this

*1 - Will match zero or more concatenations of the number 1 together.
(1|0) - Will match either a 1 or zero but not both
1.2 - Will match 1 and 2 concatenated together. 

Given these three cases we can create more complicated regex. Our program determines if a given string is a regex and also creates a binary search tree from a given regex. All of this using recursion to practice its concept.
