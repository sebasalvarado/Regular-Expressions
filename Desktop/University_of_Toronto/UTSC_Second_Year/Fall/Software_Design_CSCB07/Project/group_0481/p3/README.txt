Phase 3 README File:Instructions to Run Dr.Flights for the First Time: Open the Android Device Monitor and push the file passwords.txt that is under p3 directory, this files contain all the admins credentials to log in to the system. Note that the admins will not be able to change their e-mail or password. So if these things want to be changed the txt file itself should be changed and pushed again. We will be referring to Before meaning before running the app and after meaning whenever the Before step was successfully completed. Upload Flights: Before:  Push all the files containing flights information into the Android Device Monitor under the app_records_data directory. After: When logged in as an Administrator upload each file of flights independently. This will store it in the system and on re-launch all the information will be saved. Upload Clients: Before: Push all the files that contain client information into the Android Device Monitor under app_records_data directory. After: When logged in as an Administrator uploads each file independently. Important: Every client will be stored in the system and by default its passwords will be its name with the first letter capitalized. A client will be able to change its password afterwards. Search For Flights: Every time that a Search is filled the Client will choose if he/she wants the result to be sorted by time or cost. If he chooses neither the result will be unsorted. A Client cannot book the same Itinerary twice and the Client will be able to see its booked Itineraries in its Home Page.
